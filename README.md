# Image_Background_Remove
This notebook, BG_Remove.ipynb, demonstrates the process of removing the background from images using deep learning techniques. The model leverages modern computer vision algorithms to detect and extract the foreground objects, while eliminating the background, which is useful for tasks like object segmentation, product photo editing, or artistic design.
